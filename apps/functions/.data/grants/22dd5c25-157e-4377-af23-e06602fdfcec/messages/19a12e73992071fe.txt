Learn how to share your Logfire logs, dashboards, and alerts with your team. Hello again! It&#39;s been a few days since you signed up to Logfire, so you might now be wondering: How do I share my logs/traces, dashboards, and alerts with my colleagues? We don&#39;t charge per seat (data volume only) so no need to feel constrained. Here&#39;s how organizations work in Logfire: As a user, you can be part of multiple organizations In each organization, you can be: Admin : Manage the organization and all its projects Member : View the organization and shared projects Guest : View only specifically shared projects How do projects work? Each organization can have multiple projects In each project, you can be: Project Admin : Full project management rights Project Member : View-only access You invite people via invitation link, which can be generated in the &#34;Invite&#34; section of either your organization or a specific project: Tip: When you invite someone to a specific project, they&#39;ll become a project member and an organization guest - giving them access to just what they need!
