Hey Homen, Thanks for doing our technical interview. We truly appreciate your interest in thrv. Unfortunately, we will not be moving forward with the next step of our process at this time. While Brook liked a great deal of what you demonstrated in the interview, there were a few critical gaps. We&#39;d like to stay in touch should the timing be right in the future. Best, Jonathan
