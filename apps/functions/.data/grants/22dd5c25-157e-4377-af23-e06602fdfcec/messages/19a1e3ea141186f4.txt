Hi Chandru, Thank you for your patience. I wanted to get the take home assignment back to you as soon as possible, however, the major delay was setting up my Azure account for the service bus and functions deployment. It kept failing due to a subscription issue, which I will further investigate once I get back home again; not sure if it has anything to do with Azure&#39;s free credit subscription offering that I just started using today. As for now, run &quot;npm run dev&quot; for the UI, and &quot;npm run server&quot; for the Agent service. I included a concise ReadMe to help walk through the project. Attached here is the github link: HomenShum/voice_email_agent: GPT-Realtime Voice Agent: A multi-tenant Azure Functions + Service Bus pipeline that automatically pulls, summarizes, embeds, and stores user emails in Pinecone for semantic search and voice-assistant queries. Supports hourly delta updates, per-user isolation via Nylas grantId, GPT-5-mini summarization, and Text-Embedding-3-Small vectors. I have also attached the zip file version. The current implementation has tools on top of our original discussion added to help the voice agent with tasks such as &quot;get total count of how many emails I have right now&quot;. However, the performance of the voice agent is not yet optimal and would need more time to tune it and implement delegation steps and verification steps in order to perform more optimally. This has been a wonderful take home assignment. Thank you very much.

Look forward to meeting you all in person tomorrow at 5PM! Your stories resonate clearly to me how hard working you are as founders, how much you care for what you do and for who you are serving. It would be an honor to continue learning and aligning with the team&#39;s vision and mission together. In just this initial interaction that I have had with you all, I foresee your team growing quickly. I see a problem that fundamentally shapes the future of our generations, and Burnt will lay the groundwork for automating this hugely impactful foundational industry. As the founders of Burnt, you give a clear impression that you understand the product and supply chain industry deeply, and are proactively meeting with the customers in person. A team like yours is unstoppable. Your approach is both hands on and clearly intended to cater to your customers. The technical prowess alone will not allow anyone to dominate the market, but a deep sense of customer obsession will get the job done.
