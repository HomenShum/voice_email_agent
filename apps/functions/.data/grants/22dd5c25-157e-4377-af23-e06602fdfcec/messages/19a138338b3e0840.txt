Hi Homen, It’s Hazim here from CoffeeSpace ☕️ Just a quick note – we’re excited to share an exclusive 25% discount (worth $300–$400) for TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 , happening next week (Oct 27–29) in San Francisco. This discount was generously created by the TechCrunch team for our community, as an alumnus of last year’s Startup Battlefield 200 . We wanted to pay it forward to our wider community of builders. To claim your ticket, just click here – the code sb20 will apply automatically. If you’re not attending, feel free to pass it along to a friend. I’ll be there too, so if you’re going do let me know! Would love to say hi in person.
