A builder conference. Hey - I’m co-hosting the 2nd Global AI Pitch Summit at the Santa Clara Convention Center this November, and if you’re building in AI, this is the one you don’t want to miss this year.

If you’re an Investor / VC → Come to discover founders who are actually shipping , compare frameworks with peers, and see where the next AI waves are forming. If you’re a Researcher / Engineer → Come to meet minds who think like you — people who care about reasoning, safety, cognition, systems, emergent complexity. This is not just an event — It’s a conversation among the people who are shaping what comes next. A thought feast. A network of peers. A home for ambitious intelligence. 🎟️ Register: https://luma.com/GAP2025 If you’d like to pitch or join a conversation on stage, just send me a message — I’ll help however I can. We’re also collecting founder stories on: What hardest lesson shaped you the most? If you feel like sharing, I’d love to hear it. If the ticket cost feels heavy right now, just tell me. I want thoughtful builders in the room, not just those with budget. LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-r-60981b9b/ 🌍 If this feels like your community, you’re welcome here.
