I can confirm these were direct supervisors and they best match the career direction I’m pursuing now: For J.P. Morgan, my formal manager of record was Barbara Silva. If you need a formal HR-line manager from JPMC, I can include Barbara as well.

I&#39;d also like to speak with Theodore &amp; John if they are open to it. https://getburnt.ai/ Book a demo here Sent via Superhuman iOS On Sun, Oct 26, 2025 at 4:39 PM, Homen Shum &lt; hshum2018@gmail.com &gt; wrote: Hi Joseph, Here are my top three references. I worked closely with each. Ordered from the time that I met them, first to latest. (15) J. Joaquín Paz Solís | LinkedIn Joaquin Paz - Ex-Google Global Product Lead &amp; AI strategist; Now Head of Sales Intelligence at Lambda Cloud We met on LinkedIn in 2019 after I placed top 10 position in a one‑month high‑frequency trading challenge. He pushed me from non‑technical to technical by giving me real product work early. We have worked on multiple projects since then, the first ever full stack application project started back in Dec 2022, when ChatGPT became popular. He asked me to work on CelebrityVoiceAI, a digital twin for famous people. In the following year, we worked on the &#34;ClickCar&#34; app for an automobile parts warehouse owner / his long term friend, which helped to provide an inventory management and recommendation AI Assistant solution for the customers that have trouble automobile mechanical issues and don&#39;t want to pay a 400% upcharge to purchase parts from the auto shops within Argentina. There were many more projects and discussions throughout the past years; He gave me a chance to learn how to get started with knowing nothing about something, and clarify ambiguous problem statements on the go. Thanks to him, I got to learn critical problem solving skills through our projects together. (15) John Clemente | LinkedIn John Clemente - Ex-Navy; Previously Director of Elevance Health; Now CEO of CosmaNeura We connected through the NuHarbor Cybersecurity hackathon in 2023. I built a semantic alert‑pairing demo that reached 86.73% cross‑vendor match accuracy. The judge took a liking given my frequent communication style and close alignment with the cybersecurity firm&#39;s project requirements, so he introduced John to me to discuss a potential opportunity to work together. As a result, we came together and founded a Clinical Management AI Assistant solution. I pulled together my own team and began building our first ever demo - &#34;Fluency Med&#34;. Borrowing UC Berkeley AI Hackathon as a platform, our demo is listed on Devpost and was delivered as a top 50 candidate out of thousands of participants with over 800+ teams. We then got invited to SkyDeck VC. Soon after, we co‑founded CosmaNeura together and built a HIPAA‑aligned Azure MVP for real‑time clinical note‑taking and medical coding assistance. He taught me how to lead, develop a business, and gave me full trust and confidence and a comrade like attitude. Throughout the days, the nights, and the weekends that we worked together, he was there with me even through the holidays, the New Years, and major family events. (16) Theodore Kee | LinkedIn Theodore Kee - Forbes 30 Under 30; J.P. Morgan, Startup Banking (Life Sciences) We met in 2024. Theo joined the same team at JPM as a Business Development VP and we began working closely and intensely for a three months period to develop the first set of SOPs and deep analytical insights for the healthcare and life sciences startup banking. One of the biggest reports we gathered is about how CRISPR was used to create the first ever gene therapy treatment for Sickle Cell Disease , the sources we cited and the upcoming FDA approval list we looked into helped turn it into a high priority project list for the JPM healthcare life science startup banking team. It also helped to set a new standard for how we conducted internal research within this new team that was acquired from Silicon Valley Bank back in 2023. He taught me orderliness, organization, higher standards, and thinking fast on the go when it comes to associating the cause and effect of multiple organizations and parties involved in a situation. Out of respect and courteousness, it would be great if I can confirm with each individual about their availability first before contacting them. They each saw how I work: clear goals, fast delivery, and long hours when needed. Happy to introduce!

I wanted to get the take home assignment back to you as soon as possible, however, the major delay was setting up my Azure account for the service bus and functions deployment. It kept failing due to a subscription issue, which I will further investigate once I get back home again; not sure if it has anything to do with Azure&#39;s free credit subscription offering that I just started using today. As for now, run &#34;npm run dev&#34; for the UI, and &#34;npm run server&#34; for the Agent service. I included a concise ReadMe to help walk through the project. Attached here is the github link: HomenShum/voice_email_agent: GPT-Realtime Voice Agent: A multi-tenant Azure Functions + Service Bus pipeline that automatically pulls, summarizes, embeds, and stores user emails in Pinecone for semantic search and voice-assistant queries. Supports hourly delta updates, per-user isolation via Nylas grantId, GPT-5-mini summarization, and Text-Embedding-3-Small vectors. I have also attached the zip file version. The current implementation has tools on top of our original discussion added to help the voice agent with tasks such as &#34;get total count of how many emails I have right now&#34;. However, the performance of the voice agent is not yet optimal and would need more time to tune it and implement delegation steps and verification steps in order to perform more optimally. This has been a wonderful take home assignment. Thank you very much.

Look forward to meeting you all in person tomorrow at 5PM! Your stories resonate clearly to me how hard working you are as founders, how much you care for what you do and for who you are serving. It would be an honor to continue learning and aligning with the team&#39;s vision and mission together. In just this initial interaction that I have had with you all, I foresee your team growing quickly. I see a problem that fundamentally shapes the future of our generations, and Burnt will lay the groundwork for automating this hugely impactful foundational industry. As the founders of Burnt, you give a clear impression that you understand the product and supply chain industry deeply, and are proactively meeting with the customers in person. A team like yours is unstoppable. Your approach is both hands on and clearly intended to cater to your customers. The technical prowess alone will not allow anyone to dominate the market, but a deep sense of customer obsession will get the job done.
