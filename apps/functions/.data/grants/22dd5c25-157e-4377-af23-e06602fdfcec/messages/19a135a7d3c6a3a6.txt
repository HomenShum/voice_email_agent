Hi Chandra and Joseph, I left my place from Fremont East Bayarea about 15 minutes ago. However, the eta is showing 5:02pm, after parking it might take me a little past 5pm start time. Will keep you posted. Look forward to seeing you all soon! Homen Shum On Wed, Oct 22, 2025 at 3:51 PM Joseph Jacob &lt; jj@theburntapp.com &gt; wrote: Appreciate the kind words Homen.

Look forward to meeting you all in person tomorrow at 5PM! Your stories resonate clearly to me how hard working you are as founders, how much you care for what you do and for who you are serving. It would be an honor to continue learning and aligning with the team&#39;s vision and mission together. In just this initial interaction that I have had with you all, I foresee your team growing quickly. I see a problem that fundamentally shapes the future of our generations, and Burnt will lay the groundwork for automating this hugely impactful foundational industry. As the founders of Burnt, you give a clear impression that you understand the product and supply chain industry deeply, and are proactively meeting with the customers in person. A team like yours is unstoppable. Your approach is both hands on and clearly intended to cater to your customers. The technical prowess alone will not allow anyone to dominate the market, but a deep sense of customer obsession will get the job done.
