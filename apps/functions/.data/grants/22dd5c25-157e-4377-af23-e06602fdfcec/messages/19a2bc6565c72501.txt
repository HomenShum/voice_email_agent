We&#39;re conjuring up Agentic Pre-merge checks that act as guardians for your repository. Plus, we&#39;ve improved organization metrics, made our GitHub integration smoother, and added a self-updating CLI that&#39;s basically immortal. Like a vampire. Pre-merge checks: Your automated code guardians Set up automated quality checks and custom organizational rules before pull requests reach your main branch. There are two kinds: built-in checks and custom checks. Built-in checks: Documentation coverage – Ensure PR docstring coverage meets your configurable threshold PR Title validation – Confirm pull request titles properly describe changes and follow naming standards Description compliance – Verify PR descriptions conform to your Git platform templates Issue alignment – Check if PRs resolve linked issues without introducing unrelated changes Custom checks: Create bespoke validation rules using plain English instructions. Custom checks harness AI to interpret and enforce sophisticated requirements that extend beyond basic code quality measurements. Available commands: @coderabbitai run pre-merge checks – Execute all active validation checks @coderabbitai evaluate custom pre-merge check --name &lt;check_name&gt; – Preview custom validation behavior @coderabbitai ignore pre-merge checks – Bypass validation failures when necessary Want to see how this works? Check out this PR from LangFlow -&gt; Learn more about Pre-merge Checks Organization metrics in custom reports Your custom reports can now include organization-wide statistics. They’re perfect for leadership briefings and team performance analysis. Simply include &lt;include_org_stats&gt; in your report prompt to access metrics straight from your dashboard. What you can track : Developer activity – PRs created, reviews performed, CodeRabbit reviews triggered per contributor Code quality trends – Issues found, refactor suggestions, tool findings by category Team velocity – Active repositories, PRs merged, suggestions accepted, learnings applied -&gt; See the custom reports documentation Improved GitHub connection experience We&#39;ve created an improved GitHub integration setup that makes getting started more intuitive and more efficient than ever. What&#39;s new : Organization selection – If you belong to multiple organizations, you&#39;ll now select which organization to install CodeRabbit in directly during onboarding Combined repository and permissions setup – Repository selection and permissions review now happen together in a single step Optional first review – After setup completes, you can immediately trigger a code review on an existing pull request to see CodeRabbit in action, or skip ahead to configure settings -&gt; See the GitHub integration documentation CLI: Auto-updating capabilities Our CLI now performs automatic self-updates behind the scenes, no more manual coderabbit update commands required! Your command-line tool maintains the latest capabilities without disrupting your development flow. This version also introduces intelligent agent recognition to enhance our integration capabilities. When you invoke the CLI through Claude Code or Cursor, we can now identify your development environment automatically to build better integrations. To upgrade manually: curl -fsSL https://cli.coderabbit.ai/install.sh | sh ▶ ▶ -&gt; See the CLI documentation for more details CodeRabbit + Vercel: AI code reviews integrated in Vercel CodeRabbit brings AI-powered code reviews directly to your Vercel projects – catching bugs, securing your code, and accelerating shipping with context-aware reviews and one-click fixes.
