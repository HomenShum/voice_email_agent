- Follow up on active applications and interviews: send brief thank-you/availability notes and request feedback where appropriate (JJA.CO, Sage Care, thrv, Burnt); log outcomes and next steps.
- Shortlist and apply this week to top job leads: 1–3 tailored LinkedIn/company roles and 2–4 Upwork gigs (focus: AI/GenAI, prompt engineering, agent workflows, n8n/Make automation, RAG/chatbots, full‑stack Python); prepare resume, cover letter, proposals, and portfolio links.
- Respond to recruiter and networking messages (MaxEleven, Nikhil, LinkedIn connections), confirm calendar slots, and send any requested materials or interview availability.
- Resolve urgent account/security/finance items: investigate the Google security alert and enable 2FA, confirm Azure free account and billing limits, renew CoveredCA to keep the $0 Silver plan if needed, and reconcile recent payments (Gusto, Venmo, Chase).
- Register or confirm attendance for priority events and hackathons (TechCrunch Disrupt + CoffeeSpace discount, Vibe AI Workflows Hackathon, Self‑Evolving Agents Hack, AI Dev/BUILD/Pulumi workshops, Pydantic meetup) and secure/confirm ticket logistics for concerts if attending.
- Complete key admin tasks and platform actions: finish Mercury business credit app if outstanding, claim platform promos/credits (TechCrunch, Windsurf), accept relevant tool invites (Logfire/Streamlit) and evaluate product updates that affect projects (Claude memory, MGX).
- Tidy inbox and notification noise: create filters for Upwork/job alerts, promos, and newsletters; unsubscribe from low‑value lists; save/read high‑value items (Neo4j newsletter, GPTDAO/OpenAI announcements).

Executive paragraph
Inbox activity is concentrated on AI/job leads (many Upwork gigs and LinkedIn alerts for GenAI, automation, and full‑stack roles), active application/interview follow‑ups, several time‑sensitive events and hackathons, and a handful of account/security and payment tasks. Priorities for this week are: follow up on viewed and in‑progress applications, quickly shortlist and apply to the best LinkedIn and Upwork opportunities with tailored materials, respond to recruiter and networking messages, resolve security/finance items (Google alert, Azure, CoveredCA, payments), register/confirm event attendance and ticket logistics, and trim inbox noise while saving relevant newsletters and product updates.
