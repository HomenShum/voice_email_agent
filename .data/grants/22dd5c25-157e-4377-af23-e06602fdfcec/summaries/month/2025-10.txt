- Set Upwork filters/alerts for keywords n8n, automation, AI, SaaS, Supabase, HeyGen, Eleven Labs to capture similar opportunities and reduce noise.

2) Executive paragraph
In October 2025 Upwork sent Homen 15 new-job alerts (Oct 6–24) heavily skewed toward n8n workflow and automation roles plus several higher-value Full‑Stack/SaaS and AI integration projects. Key items: multiple n8n positions (including error resolution and e‑commerce/HeyGen integrations), specialized integration jobs (N8N & Eleven Labs, Fathom → ChatGPT), and Full‑Stack AI/SaaS builds (notably on 2025-10-06, 10-08, 10-15). Recommended next steps are to prioritize and submit tailored proposals for the n8n and SaaS listings, update the profile/portfolio to emphasize relevant tech (n8n, Supabase, RAG, APIs), and set focused Upwork alerts to capture similar opportunities.
