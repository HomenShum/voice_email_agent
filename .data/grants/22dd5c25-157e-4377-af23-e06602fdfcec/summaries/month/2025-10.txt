Between 2025-10-06 and 2025-10-24 Homen received 16 Upwork job alerts (from donotreply@upwork.com) heavily concentrated on n8n automation and AI/SaaS work — seven n8n-specific listings (including HeyGen news bulletin, error resolution, Eleven Labs integration and e‑commerce workflows) plus several full‑stack and platform builds (notably a Subscription + AI‑Powered Full SaaS Build on 2025-10-15 and multiple AI SaaS engineer roles).
