- Prepare proposal assets: create tailored templates and one-pagers for n8n automation, API/onboarding work (Al & Software Implementor), Eleven Labs & HeyGen integrations, Fathom→Chat GPT workflows, and Supabase/RAG agent projects to speed submissions.
- Update profile/portfolio: highlight recent SaaS, AI agents, e‑commerce, and Amazon Seller Space experience; attach relevant case studies to support Full-Stack and automation proposals.
- Process improvements: set Upwork saved searches/filters for n8n, automation, AI/SaaS keywords and enable instant alerts; consolidate job tracking (spreadsheet or project board) with dates, budgets, and next steps.
- Schedule workload: block 3–4 hours over the next 3 days to customize and send 3–5 proposals (start with the n8n + Subscription/SaaS leads).
