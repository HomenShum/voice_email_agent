## What Was Tested

### 1. Unit Tests (11 Tests, <1 second)
- **Contract Tests**: API exports, wiring, narration messages
- **Behavioral Tests**: Event distribution, queue ordering, DI support
- **Integration Tests**: Mock runners, mock sessions, full flow

**Key Validation**:
- ✅ Backend runtime exports correct APIs
- ✅ Event stream distributes to multiple subscribers
- ✅ Voice narration queues events in order
- ✅ Acknowledgement happens before backend execution
- ✅ Final summary happens after backend execution
- ✅ UI dashboard receives all events
- ✅ Disconnect handles multiple fallback methods
- ✅ Tool call records preserve IDs
- ✅ DI seams allow testing without external calls

### 2. E2E Tests (9 Cases, ~30 seconds)
- **Search**: security-alert, uc-berkeley-event, yelp-prompt, bandsintown, upwork-job
- **Aggregation**: rollup-week, rollup-month, unread-delta, attachment-summary

**Key Validation**:
- ✅ Search pipeline working correctly
- ✅ Aggregation pipeline working correctly
- ✅ Metadata preservation accurate
- ✅ Boolean fields properly typed
- ✅ LLM judge approves 100% of results
- ✅ No regressions in stable cases

## Architecture Highlights

### Backend Processing Layer ✅
- Uses standard `Agent` with `gpt-5-mini` model
- Handles all business logic and tool execution
- Emits events for voice narration and UI dashboard
- Supports dependency injection for testing

### Voice Narration Layer ✅
- Uses `RealtimeAgent` with `gpt-realtime-mini` model
- Provides real-time voice feedback to user
- Queues events and narrates in order
- Supports session injection for testing
- Defensive disconnect handling

### Event Bridge ✅
- Pub/sub pattern for event distribution
- Voice acknowledgement before backend execution
- Final summary after backend completion
- UI dashboard event forwarding
- No coupling between layers

---

## Code Changes

### Minimal, Focused Changes
- **3 files modified** (DI support only)
- **12 files added** (tests + documentation)
- **~20 lines of production code changed**
- **~1,500 lines of tests + docs added**

### Backward Compatible
- ✅ Existing code unaffected
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Optional DI parameters
- ✅ All existing tests still pass
